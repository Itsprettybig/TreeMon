When a male plant of one strain pollinates a female of another strain, the seeds will be F1 hybrids of the male and female. 
These offspring will not be identical to their parents. Instead, they will have characteristics of both parents. 
Repeated breeding results in certain characteristics appearing with greater regularity.

A common technique to stabilize a cannabis variety is called "cubing".[citation needed] A breeder seeking specific traits
 in the hybrid offspring (for example, greater resin production or tighter node spacing) will breed hybrid plants most exemplifying
  these characteristics with a parent plant. The same traits are sought in the new inbred offspring, which are then again bred with 
  the original parent plant. This process is called cubing because it usually repeated across three, or possibly more generations
   before the variety's genetics are acceptably stable.

Selfing
Selfing is the ability for a plant to produce seeds without the aid of another plant. This refers to hermaphrodite plants that self- pollinate. 
There is no such thing as a ‘gene pool’ or population with regards to hermaphrodites since the only pollen that a hermaphrodite will use is the
 pollen that it generates itself. Both male and female flowers are located on the same plant. There can be variations in the offspring though.

It is impossible for a hermaphrodite to create any male only plants. A hermaphrodite may create female only seeds and hermaphrodite seeds. Also 
the female only seeds may carry the hermaphrodite trait.[5]

Varieties:  Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa.[1] A third species, Cannabis ruderalis ybrid varieties with varying ratios of these three types are common

 autoflowering
	
    Clone-only variety – The grower may distribute genetically identical clones of the plant. A clone is the only way to propagate a plant while
	 retaining its exact genetic makeup. Nevertheless, the conditions under which the plant is grown will still greatly affect the final product.

    Stable seed variety – Creating a genetically stable variety involves selectively choosing male and female cannabis plants and breeding them over 
	the course of multiple generations. The final generation's seeds reliably grow into plants that exhibit the desired characteristics, 
	though some genetic variation will still occur.

    Unstable seed varieties – Unstable varieties are produced without numerous generations of breeding. Although they can be produced quickly, plants 
	grown from these seeds may have widely varying characteristics. Commercial seed retailers generally do not distribute unstable seed varieties, 
	though some disreputable shops might. Amateur and third-party growers may, whether knowingly or not, produce unstable derivatives 
	from well known varieties and misleadingly call them by their true variety name.

    Wild varieties or landraces – Some varieties, such as Colombian and Thai, refer to Cannabis plants found growing wild in certain regions. 
	Typically, these plants are used as bases for the production of more specialized varieties, such as G-13 or Hash.

"Lowryder" was an early auto-flowering hybrid that retained the flowering behavior of ruderalis plants, while also producing appreciable amounts of THC and CBD.
 Autoflowering cannabis varieties have the advantage of being discreet due to their small stature. They also require shorter growing periods, as 
 well as having the additional advantage that they do not rely on a change in the photoperiod to determine when to flowe
