7. Licensee’s Responsibilities
7.1. Licensee may not access or use the TreeMon.org API for any purposes if it is a direct competitor of TreeMon.
7.2. End Users shall be Subscribers to Services. Licensee must use best efforts to ensure that TreeMon.org Applications do not permit End Users who are not Subscribers to access or use the Services. In the event Licensee discovers that an End User is not a Subscriber, Licensee shall use best efforts to prevent that End User from using the TreeMon.org Application.
7.3. With respect to the TreeMon.org Applications, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that TreeMon.org has no obligations, responsibilities, or liabilities to End Users.
7.4. Licensee must comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the EULA in all uses of the TreeMon.org API, Account Data, and the Services. Licensee must also comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the TreeMon’s then-current trademark and branding guidelines in all uses of the TreeMon.org Marks.
7.5. Licensee’s TreeMon.org Application must not be intended to or designed to facilitate a violation of the EULA or this Agreement by End Users, including without limitation the use policies set forth in the EULA. In the event TreeMon.org reasonably believes Licensee’s TreeMon.org Application violates this Section 7.5, Licensee shall, promptly upon written notice and at Licensee’s sole cost, modify and redistribute the TreeMon.org Application and use its best efforts to disable or otherwise prevent End Users from using prior versions of the TreeMon.org Application that violate this Section 7.5. In no event will Licensee encourage its End Users to violate, or instruct its End Users on how to violate, the EULA or this Agreement.
7.6. In order to use and access the TreeMon.org API, Licensee must obtain API credentials (a“Token”) by becoming a Subscriber. Licensee may not share its Token, shall keep such Token and all login information secure, and shall use it as Licensee’s sole means of accessing the TreeMon.org API.
7.7. Licensee’s TreeMon.org Applications shall not substantially replicate products or services offered by TreeMon, including, without limitation, functions or clients on platforms (such as iOS or Android) where TreeMon.org offers its own client or a substantially similar function. By way of example only, Licensee may not develop a TreeMon.org Application for use on an iPhone that permits an End User to make general phone calls to the public switched telephone network because doing so would substantially replicate TreeMon’s mobile application for the iPhone. Licensee agrees that TreeMon.org may develop and publish applications that are similar to or otherwise compete with Licensee’s applications.
7.8. TreeMon.org Applications may not use or access the TreeMon.org API or the Services in order to monitor the availability, performance, or functionality of the TreeMon.org API or Services or for any similar benchmarking or competitive purposes.

In addition, Licensee shall not, and shall not attempt to, interfere with, modify or disable any features, functionality or security controls of the Services or the TreeMon.org API; defeat, avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate or otherwise circumvent any protection mechanisms for the Services or the TreeMon.org API; or reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or derive source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, structure, or organizational form from the Services or the TreeMon.org API.
7.12. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely responsible, and that TreeMon.org has no responsibility or liability of any kind, for (a) the content, development, operation, sale, support, or maintenance of TreeMon.org Applications; or (b) Licensee’s inability to continue providing TreeMon.org Applications (in whole or part) due to the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee will be solely responsible for (i) the installation, operation, maintenance, and support of its TreeMon.org Applications; (ii) creating and displaying information and content on, through or within its TreeMon.org Applications; (iii) ensuring that its TreeMon.org Applications do not violate or infringe the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (iv) ensuring that TreeMon.org Applications are not offensive, profane, obscene, libelous or otherwise illegal; (v) ensuring that its TreeMon.org Applications do not contain or introduce Malicious Software into the Services, the TreeMon.org API, any Account Data or other data stored or transmitted using the Service, or Subscriber Components; (vi) ensuring that its TreeMon.org Applications are not designed to or utilized for the purpose of sending Spam to any TreeMon.org Subscribers or others; and (vii) transitioning End Users off a TreeMon.org Application when that TreeMon.org application is no longer available for any reason.

Prior to accessing any Subscriber’s account or Account Data or otherwise utilizing a Subscriber’s Services, Licensee shall disclose in writing and reasonable detail to the Subscriber (a) that the TreeMon.org Application will have Account Access; (b) the nature of the Account Access, including without limitation how the Service will be used and what Account Data will be accessed or modified by the TreeMon.org Application; and (c) where, if applicable, Account Data may be stored, transmitted, or accessed outside of TreeMon.org Components. The Subscriber must provide express consent prior to any Account Access, and such consent shall be limited to the scope of what is disclosed in the previous sentence (the “Subscriber’s Access Consent”). Licensee shall promptly cease any Account Access upon the Subscriber’s withdrawal of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.
7.15. In no event shall Licensee or the TreeMon.org Application engage in Account Access or transmit, store, or access Account Data outside the scope of the Subscriber’s Access Consent.
7.16. Sections 7.14 to 7.15 shall not apply to the extent (and only to the extent) that Licensee uses a TreeMon.org Application solely with its own subscription to the Services. Licensee’s consent to such Account Access shall be deemed given in such cases.
